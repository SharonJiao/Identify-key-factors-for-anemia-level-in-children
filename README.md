# Methodology: 
Read and load data file, exploratory data analysis, including missing value and duplicated value checking; plotting each variable using seaborn barplot and histogram plot for continuous numerical variables. Followed by Label encoding of categorical data; target variable data distribution analysis; feature selection using variance threshold and correlation matrix. Create a lazy classifier to run all the relevant models for further analysis. Choose the best-performed model for model training and accuracy evaluation.
